# Clean Vite React-TS boilerplate

I've found Vite to be really cool. But the default install of `--template react-ts` doesn't have absolute imports, and this is really painfull... So, I've made a clean vite boilerplate by myself 👍

## Absolute imports!

Just import stuff from `./src` just like this: `import stuff from "~/import-what-you-like"` 😀
